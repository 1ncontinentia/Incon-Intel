## INCONTINENTIA'S INTEL (alpha)

Requires: CBA


#### Features

INTEL

* Made for ALiVE
* Units drop intel when they are killed

Dropped intel will: 
* Find ALiVE asym opcom installations
* Track phone contacts on map (requires UAV terminal)
* Track radio contacts on map (requires UAV terminal)
* Tracking accuracy depends on the weather, overhead cover, range etc.


#### Usage

Place the INCON folder, initUnits.sqf, description.ext and init.sqf all in your mission root folder. 

If you already have a description.ext or init.sqf, add the lines from these files into your pre-existing ones.

Change your settings in the INT_setup.sqf file.


#### Future Plans

Options to turn on tracking and turn it off

Better tracking markers

Greater configurability of settings


#### Credits

Massive thanks to Spyderblack723 for all the help over this past year or so and whose awesome Spyder Addons mod inspired me to make stuff.
Also, thank you to davidoss, Grumpy Old Man, Tajin and sarogahtyp for coming up with the basis for the detection functions, as well as the guys on Arma 3 discord.
Lots of other people deserve thanks too I'm sure!
